            inspired by the way traditional crafts and materials represent the
            history of a culture, kristine pe√±afiel salviejo collaborates with
            local craftspeople in various places in the world. the collections
            are meant to support the artisans and local communities while also

            kristine is influenced by her own nomadic lifestyle and how that can
            limit and enhance her everyday - not to be less attached but to have

            the webshop sells pieces from the collections as well as souvenirs
